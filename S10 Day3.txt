Day 3: Conditional Probability

Objective

In this challenge, we get started with conditional probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!


Task

Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

Soln : 

Let's write the sample space:

BB, BG, GB, GG

But we know that one child is a boy, so that means that GG isn't a possibility. Thus, the sample space is reduced to: BB, BG, GB.

Therefore, the probability of both children being boys given that one is a boy is 1/3.

Final Answer = 1/3


Day 3: Cards of the Same Suit

Objective

In this challenge, we're getting started with combinations and permutations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!


Task

You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

Soln : 

We have 4 suits.

Logically, After the first draw, regardless of what card we draw the probability remain same for the second draw. 
There are four colors and as which color of card is chosen is not provided. It can be any color card.

So, For first draw, Probability of choosing a card is 1.

For second draw, probability of choosing a color card is 13/52.

But, we have not inserted the card back. So, the probability is: 12/51.

Final Answer: 12/51


Day 3: Drawing Marbles

Objective

In this challenge, we're reinforcing what we've learned today. In case you've missed them, today's tutorials are on 
Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations.

Task

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Soln : Number of red marbles = 3
Number of blue marbles = 4
Total number of marbles = 3+4 = 7
When first marble is taken out ,

Total number of marbles = 7-1=6
Number of red marbles = 3-1 = 2
Number of blue marbles = 4


Probability of second marble to be blue = Number of blue marbles / Number of marbles left

= 4/6

= 2/3
